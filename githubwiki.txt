<a name="introduction"></a>
# Introduction 
This extension generates an Excel file that allows to simulate the grade impact and effort to fix a number of violations for a set of quality rules.    

<a name="situation"></a>
# In what situation should you install this extension?  
When you want to do a grade / effort simulation and identify quickly the quick wins  
When you don't have access to the Cast environment, or only access trough the Engineering dashboard REST API, and not able to use Dashboard Action Plan Recommendation or Action Plan Optimizer.  
When you want to understand how the grades are computed at application level  
   
<a name="aipcompatibility"></a>
# CAST AIP versions compatibility

This extension is compatible with all AIP versions 8.3.x  
<a name="supporteddbms"></a>
# Supported DBMS servers
N/A

<a name="configuration"></a>
# Configuration instructions
You need to configure either the batch file provided, or the command line running the python script.
You need to provide the CAST Engineering Dashboard URL and credentials.
<a name="operation"></a>
# Operation instructions
Requires a Python runtime 3.6 and 3 python libraries (that are installed by pip as the first step of the batch).  
Run the batch file or the command line running the python script to generate the Excel file.  

<a name="expect"></a>
# What results can you expect?
For each application, and only for the last snapshot : 
1 Excel file named <Application name>_simulation.xlsx is generated.  
The remediation efforts are pre-loaded from CAST_QualityRulesEffort.csv file into the Excel, but can be modified in the Excel file.  
By default only the violations are not loaded, but you have an option to load them.   
  
You can change the number of violations that will be fixed and you will have the grade and efforts simulations computed in the Excel file.   

Parameters available :     
- Application name (regexp): -applicationfilter, if Empty all the application that are configured in the different engineering domains will be processed  
- Load violations: -loadviolations True/False default False  
- Quality rule id (regexp): -qridfilter  
- Quality rule name (regexp): -qrnamefilter  
- Business criterion: -businesscriterionfilter (60017,60016,60013,60014,60011,60012), can be a multiple value, separated with comma, default "Empty" (All)  
- Technology: -technofilter List of technologies separated by a comma, default "Empty" (All)  
- Log level: -loglevel INFO/DEBUG, default INFO  
- Maximum number of rows: -nbrows int value, default 1000000000 (has a high impact of performance, but is truncating the data)

- Only the last snapshot data are exported in the Excel file  
- Only the Full application mode is covered. The legacy consolidation mode like Aggregation by Number of Artifacts, ... is not managed
- Since 1.1.0 when the Rules Grade / Nb violations for action is manually changed, you need to wait 3-4 seconds because of all excel formulas added in this release

# Release Notes
## Version 1.2.0
Add the option to have the simulation at the module level
## Version 1.1.0
Rules grades :  
Add a column "Grade improvement priority" to show the quality rules that have the highest impact on technical criteria / health factors grades    
Add a column "Nb violations to fix on this rule before rule grade improvement"  
Add a column "Nb rules to fix before TC grade improvement" when several critical rules are impacting the TC grade to 1  
Add a column "Nb violations to fix on the TC rules before TC grade improvement", same reason as above line  
Add a column "Technical criterion" 
Fix the grade delta formula  
Fix the connection to AIP Console integrated Rest API  
The url must now include /rest  
Simplify the template batch file  
## Version 1.0.3
Minor improvements & fixes
## Version 1.0.2
